# AGENTS.md - openlink / op4n.link

This repository contains product description, frontend, and product logic for
**openlink**, a link creation and management dashboard for shortening URLs,
generating QR codes, tracking engagement, and managing branded link pages.

Primary product domain: `op4n.link`

Reference products:
- `shorturl.at` for the minimal paste URL -> shorten -> copy experience
- `app.bitly.com` for managed dashboard patterns, analytics, branding, and link lifecycle tooling

When reference copy in the PRD says "Bitly", treat it as reference language unless
the task explicitly asks to reproduce that wording. Prefer `openlink` and
`op4n.link` in product UI and implementation.

---

## Product Promise

openlink helps users turn long URLs into short, shareable links in seconds, then
manage those links from a centralized dashboard.

Core promise:
- Paste a long URL
- Create a short link
- Copy and share it immediately
- Optionally create a QR code
- Track and manage link performance over time

The product must keep the quick-create flow low friction while gradually exposing
advanced features such as custom back-halves, QR codes, pages, analytics,
integrations, AI assistance, and paid upgrades.

---

## Personas

### Primary Persona: Normal Internet User / Digital Marketer

Example: "Kwanchanok"

Needs to shorten long URLs for social media, email campaigns, printed materials,
or everyday sharing. This user is likely on the free plan and should discover the
value of advanced features progressively.

### Secondary Persona: Growth-Focused Power User

Needs campaign tracking, custom branded pages, bulk link creation, integrations,
deeper analytics, and branded domains. This persona is the target for contextual
upgrade prompts.

---

## Product Structure

### Sidebar Navigation

A vertical icon-based sidebar is fixed to the left edge of every page. Icon-only
items must include hover tooltips and keyboard-accessible labels.

Routes:
- `+` Create new: opens creation context menu
- `/discover`: Discover what openlink provides
- `/links`: default landing page after login
- `/trackings`: analytics for links
- `/launchpads`: link-in-bio / branded landing pages
- `/settings/profile`: account preferences

### Global Top Navigation

Persistent across dashboard pages:
- Global heading / promotional text
- Greeting copy such as "Hello, Tell the world what you do"

### Default Landing

The default authenticated dashboard experience is `/links`. Users do not need to
log in to land on Home/Links, but after sign-up/login this page becomes the main
action hub.

---

## Core Journey 1: Home Quick Create

The `/links` dashboard must present link creation as the primary above-the-fold
action.

Required elements:
- Destination URL input with placeholder `https://example.com/my-long-url`
- Fixed free-tier domain indicator for `op4n.link` with a lock icon
- Usage indicator, for example: "You can create 3 more links this month."
- Primary CTA to create a short link
- Optional unchecked checkbox: "Also create a QR Code for this link"
- Contextual upgrade banner: "Get custom links and a complimentary domain" with
  an "Upgrade now" link

Success state:
- Display the created short link immediately
- Provide a one-click Copy button using the Clipboard API
- Show transient copy/create confirmation via toast or inline message
- Decrement the usage counter in real time

Validation and limits:
- Validate URL format before submission
- Show inline errors for blank or malformed URLs
- Enforce free-tier monthly link caps with clear inline or modal messaging
- QR co-creation checkbox defaults to unchecked

Performance and accessibility:
- Dashboard should load within 2 seconds on standard broadband
- Navigation must be keyboard accessible
- Icon-only navigation must expose tooltip labels on hover/focus

---

## Core Journey 2: Dedicated Link Creation

Route: `/links/create`

Entry points:
- `+ Create new` from the sidebar

## Data Model Guidance

Use structured link records. Keep implementation modular so quick-create,
dedicated create, library cards, analytics, QR code state, and pages can share
the same data shape.

Suggested link shape:

```json
{
  "id": "link_123",
  "title": "Spring campaign",
  "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/my-long-url",
  "shortDomain": "op4n.link",
  "backHalf": "spring-campaign",
  "shortUrl": "https://op4n.link/spring-campaign",
  "status": "active",
  "createdAt": "2026-04-13T00:00:00.000Z",
  "tags": [],
  "qrCodeId": null,
  "pageIds": [],
  "utm": null,
  "expiresAt": null,
  "analytics": {
    "clicks": 0,
    "scans": 0
  }
}
```

Suggested quota shape:

```json
{
  "plan": "free",
  "linksRemaining": 3,
  "customBackHalvesRemaining": 3,
  "qrCodesRemaining": 2,
  "bulkUploadEnabled": false,
  "aiEnabled": false,
  "exportEnabled": false
}
```

## Design System

Visual direction:
- Clean SaaS dashboard
- Minimal, soft, high whitespace
- Neutral base with content and primary actions standing out
- Avoid overly colorful UI

Typography:
- Modern sans-serif
- Inter or system UI stack preferred

Components:
- Buttons similar to shadcn/ui
- Cards with subtle borders/shadows
- Minimal toggles
- Clear inline validation
- Toasts for transient success/error feedback

Icons:
- Prefer Google Material Icons / Material Symbols already used in the repo
- Use lock icon for free-tier restrictions
- Use crown/upgrade icon for paid advanced settings
- Use sparkle icon for AI features

Color:
- Neutral white/gray base
- Dark or navy primary CTA
- Paid/gated states should be clear but not distracting

---

## Interaction Rules

Must do:
- Make quick link creation possible within seconds
- Keep advanced features discoverable but non-blocking
- Preserve user input on failed submissions
- Update quotas and counters in real time after creation
- Use inline validation for URL and back-half errors
- Keep keyboard accessibility for navigation, forms, toggles, and dismissible panels
- Persist session preferences such as filters, collapsed sections, and creation mode

Must not do:
- Do not silently fail gated features
- Do not force navigation for inline options like Add to Page
- Do not clear forms after errors
- Do not make paid prompts block the core free link-shortening action
- Do not overcomplicate the primary paste URL -> create -> copy path

---

## Build Priority

1. `/links` dashboard with quick-create panel
2. URL validation, result state, copy button, and quota counter
3. Link library cards with search and active status filtering
4. `/links/create` full-page form with collapsible sections
5. QR code co-creation and quota behavior
6. Upgrade prompts for gated features
7. Bulk toolbar and view layout persistence
8. AI Assist, onboarding widget, and integrations carousel
9. Bulk upload flow
10. Deeper analytics and tracking pages

---

## Developer Notes

- Prioritize speed over perfection, but keep the product flow coherent.
- Ship the simplest working path first: create a short link and copy it.
- Keep naming product-native: openlink / `op4n.link`.
- Treat Bitly and shorturl.at as references, not brand names to copy by default.
- Keep UI behavior modular around link records, quotas, filters, and feature gates.
- Favor inline, contextual upgrade prompts over disruptive paywalls.
- Avoid unrelated refactors when implementing a PRD slice.
